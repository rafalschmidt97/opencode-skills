description: >-
  Compact the current conversation into a handoff document for another agent
  session to pick up. Use when the user says "handoff", "hand off", "save
  context", "write a handoff", "summarize for next session", or wants to
  capture the current session state so a fresh agent can continue the work.

Write a handoff document summarising the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue the work. Save it to a path produced by `mktemp -t handoff-XXXXXX.md` (read the file before you write to it).

Suggest the skills to be used, if any, by the next session.

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts (PRDs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits, diffs). Reference them by path or URL instead.

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus on and tailor the doc accordingly.
